      <h2>A Brief <span style="color: #FF83A8">Biography</span></h2>
      <br />
     <blockquote cite="http://barbaraoakley.com/">"I love to bring fresh perspectives into my books by applying knowledge and experience from many different disciplines, as well as from “real world” experiences. Although I’m now a professor of engineering, I’ve also worked in lots of different places and doing very different things: serving as a Russian translator on Soviet trawlers up in the Bering Sea, teaching in China, going from US Army private to Regular Army Captain, and working as a radio operator at the South Pole Station in the Antarctic. (I met my husband there—I had to go to the end of the earth to meet that man!)"

   <h2>Why Barbara <span style="color: #FF83A8">Inspires</span> Me</h2>
    <br />
    <p>What most inspires me about Barbara is the fact that into her mid-twenties she was not mathematical at all. Nevertheless she returned to  university for a mathematics degree, eventually going on to become a mathematics professor! As someone who has struggled with mathematics I really appreciate a true example of how hard-work, dilligence and persistence can sometimes subvert what one takes to be one's 'innate abilities'.</p>
