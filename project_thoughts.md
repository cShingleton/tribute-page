<h2>(17/03/17) Project Thoughts: </h2>

Im effect this has been my first truly solo project in a long time. I've learnt coding on and off for a while now but hav decided to really knuckle down this time around in preparation for my bootcamp. Owing to having been away from it for some time this website hasn't come out the best but evertheless it has been a useful learning exercise in helping to determine my current baseline of ability. Further, at the very least, it passes the user stories for the FreeCodeCamp Basic Front-End project on which it was based.

<h3>Techinque Breakdown</h3>
A few useful techniques came back to me and inspired me to make some educated Google searches but its actual website versatility registers little to none. I also wanted to avoid using a framework like Bootstrap as currently my understanding of it is farily limited and I don't intend to pick it up again for a few weeks. Currently I just want to get more comfortable with CSS3. 
Some notes:

- Getting the sidebar to cooperate seemed unreasonably difficult. There must be a more effective way to implement them other than with floats but if there is my Googling skills aren't up to par yet. As it happens, the rather hacky implementation of a top layer sidebar with content over an underlying plain sidebar I have in place works pretty well for my needs. I especially liked how it allowed for a background picture of Barbara that I could add transparency to. In that vein though, I wasn't sure how to blur the bottom edge of the picture so there's a rather unslightly sudden line where the overlapping sidebar next begins. It's not great, but it's bearable. 

- I really wanted to figure ou thow to make individual sections span the entire width of the page but everything i did either resulted in terrible text alignment or messed up the sidebar. I was insistent on each particular section taking up 100% width of their parent 'content' container but they just didn't want to seem to play nice. This may be something to come back to or may be a result of the hacky sidebar. My other thought was to have the timeline as a header and the inspiration as a footer spanning the entirety of the page above and below the sidebar. This may work but I'm not sure about how it would affect the flow of the page and it may look a little odd. Again, something to come back to. 

- My use of selectors is really shoddy at this stage. Seem to be selecting with very inappropriate means. Excessive and superfluous use of 'selector trees' that could be replaced with something more compact.

- I need to refer to a CSS3 stylign guide that gives input on how to arrange all of the rules in the CSS stylesheet. 

- The layout of the bio and photo was frustrating. I tried using a flexbox but then had issues with resizing the image without distorting it. 

-  Some time spent on design theory in week 2 will do me well as I'm not sure where the pink and grey came from but I seem to have made Barbara a Jack Wills posterchild. My apologies Barbara for the horrible association.
